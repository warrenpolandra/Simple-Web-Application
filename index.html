                    <p>A barrier island near Savannah. Nordic architecture-style island: organic modernism, where the shapes are inspired by nature—rock walls or sweeping glass bay windows. This island also has some path with white limestone. Every single building in this island is covered with concrete, starting from the Dining Hall, The Warehouse, even the Chefs' houses. You can clearly see the façade of the restaurant as well as enough hallway. This island is specifically designed for the finest dining in the world.</p>


                    <p>To get to this island, you'll have to get on a boat and travels 5 miles from Savannah. Upon reaching this island, you'll be greeted by our reception and will immediately start your exclusively prepared island tour. You'll see all of the spectacular views in this island and all of the buildings here. This island consist of several buildings, such as the Main Dining Hall where you'll eat your 13 course dishes, the warehouse where all of the ingredients are stored, and the Head Chef House.</p>

                    <p>Kitchen is like a chef's toy, a sandbox for the chef to play in. They want a fire pit where they can do whatever they want — hang birds or roast eggplant over the fire. It's an expensive habit. Chefs should know what a cord of wood costs in their area. They could spend a couple thousand a month on wood. they've got ash storage, wood storage, separate exhaust fan systems. There are a lot of expenses before they get into it but they feel they really have to have it.</p>
